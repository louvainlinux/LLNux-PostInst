LLNux PostInstall
===================================

An Ubuntu post-installation script launched just after an fresh installation by Louvain-li-Nux users 

Firstly, thank you to Alin Andrei from WebUpd8 for the idea and the first implementation of this script.

How to use it?
--------------

Simply download the content and double click on 'ubuntu-11.10-matttbe-mirror' / Launch from a Terminal
Please note that messages of this script are in French but any help to translate it are welcome ;)
Also, the default option use our local Ubuntu mirror...


I want to add / change something 
--------------------------------

You are welcome!
Fork this repository ;)
