LLNux PostInstall
===================================

An Ubuntu (and derivatives such as Ubuntu Gnome, Xubuntu and Linux Mint) post-installation script launched just after an fresh installation by Louvain-li-Nux users

Firstly, thank you to Alin Andrei from WebUpd8 for the idea and the first implementation of this script.

How to use it?
--------------

Simply download the content and double click on 'postinstall.sh' / Launch from a Terminal.

Please note that messages of this script are in French but translations from the previous version (10.10 is still available on webupd8) ;)

By default, the script will try to reach our local proxy/mirror.
