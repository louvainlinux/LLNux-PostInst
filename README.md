Louvain-li-Nux post-install script
===================================

An Ubuntu (and derivatives such as Ubuntu Gnome, Xubuntu and Linux Mint) post-installation script launched just after an fresh installation by Louvain-li-Nux users

How to use it?
--------------

Simply download the content and double click on 'postinstall.sh' / Launch from a Terminal.

Please note that messages of this script are in French but translations from the previous version (10.10 is still available on webupd8) ;)

By default, the script will try to reach our local proxy/mirror.


I want to add / change something 
--------------------------------

You are welcome! Fork this repository ;)

Thanks
------

We would like to thanks Alin Andrei from WebUpd8, for the idea and the first implementation of this script, 
and Matthieu Baerts, who greatly improved it and maintained it over the years!
